    pip install boussole

It should be safe enough to install it on Linux, MacOSX and Windows until you
have the right environment (needed devel libs, etc..).

For development guideline see :ref:`intro_development`.

.. Note::
    Because some requirements need to compile some C modules, this may takes
    some minutes to install Boussole again for each of your projects under
    their own virtual environment.

    Also Libsass compatibility should be safe enough for your future projects.

    So we recommend you to install this software at your system level if
    installation speed is important to you.
