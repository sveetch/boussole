Install
=======

Just use the Pip command: ::

    pip install boussole

Or possibly your prefered package installer.

It should be safe enough to install it on Linux, MacOSX and Windows if you have a
proper environment.

.. Note::
    Some OS versions or special environments may encounter some install issues, that
    are not related to Boussole itself. You could find some workaround in this
    `Stackoverflow thread about installing packages with Pip <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35898734/pip-installs-packages-successfully-but-executables-not-found-from-command-line/43368894#43368894>`_.

For development install you should see :ref:`intro_development`.
