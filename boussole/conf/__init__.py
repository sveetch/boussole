Project configuration
=====================

Boussole work on per project configurations stored in a settings file for each
project.

Backends behavior is to search for a settings file in the given directory, read
it, possibly patch its values and then return a
:class:`boussole.conf.model.Settings object`.

Almost all paths in settings will be expanded to absolute paths if they are
not allready so:

* If the path start with a home directory character, the home directory is used
  to expand the path;
* If the path is relative, expand it to absolute using directory from settings
  file location;

Also note, that Sass files from libraries directories are never compiled.
